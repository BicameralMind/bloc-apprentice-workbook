# Workbook Mentor Guide

1. Help your apprentice walk through the getting started steps in the readme.
2. Clone their fork of the repo to your machine. I keep a folder for each student and a copy of their workbook inside it on my local machine.
3. As the course progresses, refer your apprentice to the appropriate exercise sets for their current subject.
4. When they've demonstrated understanding of a concept or mastery of a skill, check it off in their checklist and push it to their fork.
5. Use the assessment reviews for extra reinforcement before assessments.
